# Privacy Policy for SermonFlow
**Effective Date: January 30, 2026**

## 1. Introduction
SermonFlow ("we," "us," or "our") is a minimalist church note-taking application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and your spiritual reflections.

## 2. Data Storage & Firebase
SermonFlow uses Firebase (Google Cloud) for data persistence and synchronization.
* **Anonymous Authentication:** We use anonymous authentication to ensure your notes are private to your device without requiring personal email or identity data upfront.
* **Notes Content:** Your notes are stored securely in Firestore and are only accessible by your authenticated device.
* **Offline Persistence:** Notes are cached locally on your device for offline use.

## 3. Subscription & Billing
We use Apple’s in-app purchase system (StoreKit 2) for our Pro subscription. All billing and financial data is handled exclusively and securely by Apple.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We do not share your notes with third-party advertisers or data brokers. The only third-party service used is Firebase for core app functionality.

## 5. User Rights
You have the right to delete your notes at any time. Since we use anonymous authentication, your data is tied to your device signature.
