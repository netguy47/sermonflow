# Privacy Policy for SermonFlow
**Effective Date: January 30, 2026**

## 1. Introduction
SermonFlow ("we," "us," or "our") is a minimalist church note-taking application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and your spiritual reflections.

## 2. No Personal Data Collection
SermonFlow is designed to be anonymous.
* **No Account Required:** We do not require you to provide your name, email address, or phone number to use the app.
* **Anonymous Authentication:** We use Firebase Anonymous Authentication to sync your notes to the cloud without collecting your identity. This data is tied to your specific device instance.

## 3. Data Storage & Firebase
SermonFlow uses Firebase (Google Cloud) for data persistence and synchronization.
* **Notes Content:** Your notes (titles, content, and timestamps) are stored securely in Firestore and are only accessible by your authenticated device.
* **Offline Persistence:** Notes are cached locally on your device for offline use.

## 4. Subscription & Billing
We use Apple’s in-app purchase system (StoreKit 2) for our Pro subscription. All billing, credit card information, and financial data are handled exclusively and securely by Apple. We do not have access to your payment details.

## 5. Third-Party Services
We do not share your notes with third-party advertisers or data brokers. The only third-party service used is Firebase for core app functionality (Cloud storage and Auth).

## 6. Children's Privacy
SermonFlow does not knowingly collect or solicit any personal information from children under the age of 13.

## 7. Data Retention & Deletion
You may delete individual notes at any time within the app. Since we use anonymous authentication, uninstalling the app or clearing your device data will effectively "forget" your anonymous account and associated data.

## 8. Contact Us
